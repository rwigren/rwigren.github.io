Feel free to have a look!\n\nPlot quick ref Go to\nA semi-compact reference for some popular plotting frameworks in R and Python, with examples of useful plots and information about mechanics, themes, extensions and other. Currently ggplot2 and seaborn has been added and are being worked on. Future additions are likely to include Altair-vega.\n\n\nTSAutils Go to\nA small package containing utilities for time series analysis, with some useful methods for evaluation of models and time series statistics. The package mainly consists of rolling origin evaluation (a.k.a. time series cross validation) and two time series bootstrap methods (naive block-wise and AR-sieve). A future goal is a restructuring of the methods to mirror the tidyverse style and integrate well with feasts and fable packages.\n\n\nConstant shift embedding Go to\nAn implementation of the constant shift embedding (CSE) method as presented by V. Roth et al.1 Given a set of pairwise similarity (or dissimilarity), the method converts data to euclidean space such that minimizing k-means in the new space also minimizes pairwise clustering with the original (dis)similarity data.\nAlthough mapping between solutions only holds for k-means - pairwise clustering (to my knowledge), it is a good indication that the data in the euclidean space represents the (dis)similarity data well. As such the method can also be used for other problems, such as classification.\n\nV. Roth, J. Laub, M. Kawanabe and J. M.
