Hi! I'm Richard, a guy with a passion for data-modeling and clean solutions. Below are some links and explanations to some of my github projects. Feel free to have a look!


### Plot quick ref [Go to](https://rwigren.github.io/Plot-quick-ref/){.btn .btn-outline-primary .btn role="button" style="float: right;"}

A semi-compact reference for some popular plotting frameworks in R and Python, with examples of useful plots and information about mechanics, themes, extensions and other. Currently [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) and [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) has been added and are being worked on. Future additions are likely to include [Altair-vega](https://altair-viz.github.io/). 




### TSAutils [Go to](https://github.com/rwigren/TSAutils){.btn .btn-outline-primary .btn role="button" style="float: right;"}

A small package containing utilities for time series analysis, with some useful methods for evaluation of models and time series statistics. The package mainly consists of rolling origin evaluation (a.k.a. time series cross validation) and two time series bootstrap methods (naive block-wise and AR-sieve). A future goal is a restructuring of the methods to mirror the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) style and integrate well with [feasts](https://feasts.tidyverts.org/) and [fable](https://fable.tidyverts.org/) packages.



### Constant shift embedding [Go to](https://github.com/rwigren/Constant-shift-embedding){.btn .btn-outline-primary .btn role="button" style="float: right;"}

An implementation of the constant shift embedding (CSE) method as presented by V. Roth et al.^1^ Given a set of pairwise similarity (or dissimilarity), the method converts data to euclidean space such that minimizing k-means in the new space also minimizes pairwise clustering with the original (dis)similarity data.

Although mapping between solutions only holds for k-means - pairwise clustering (to my knowledge), it is a good indication that the data in the euclidean space represents the (dis)similarity data well. As such the method can also be used for other problems, such as classification.
